# Syntax Highlight for **nano**

 Contributed to prog8 by Adiee5

In order to use this. you need to download the `prog8.nanorc` file. You can download it wherever you want to, 
preferably at `~/.config/nano/`. Then, you need to include this file into your `nanorc` file 
(it's at `~/.nanorc` or `~/.config/nano/nanorc`, alternatively, you could edit the global `/etc/nanorc` file).
All you neet to do is to add this to your config file:

```nanorc
## prog8 syntax file:
 include "/path/to/your/prog8.nanorc"
```
After that, enjoy the syntax highlighting!

*************************
Software written in Prog8
*************************

Apart from the many :source:`examples <examples>` available in the source code repository,
there are also larger pieces of software written using Prog8. Here's a list.


`Assembler <https://github.com/irmen/cx16assem>`_
    File-based assembler for the Commander X16.

`Chess <https://github.com/irmen/cx16chess>`_
    Chess game for the Commander X16, with 2-player or computer opponent game modes.

`Image viewer <https://github.com/irmen/cx16imageviewer>`_
    Multi-format image viewer for the Commander X16.
    Can display cx16 BMX, C64 Koala, C64 Doodle, BMP, PCX and Amiga IFF images, including color cycling.

`Paint program <https://github.com/irmen/x16paint>`_
    Bitmap image paint program for the Commander X16, work in progress.

`Petaxian <https://github.com/cyborgar/Petaxian>`_
    Galaga type shoot em up game using only petscii graphics. Runs on C64 and Commander X16.

`Rock Runner <https://github.com/irmen/cx16rockrunner>`_
    Faithful Boulderdash clone, a well known arcade puzzle game from the 80's.
    where you must collect all diamonds in a level while avoiding the hazards to reach the exit.
    Can load the thousands of available fan made level files.
    This game is for the Commander X16.

`Shell <https://github.com/irmen/cx16shell>`_
    Unix like command shell for the Commander X16.

`Streaming Music Demo <https://github.com/irmen/cx16musicdemo>`_
    Demoscene like "music demos" for the Commander X16.
    They display graphics, animated song lyrics, and play a high quality sampled song streamed from disk.


Various things:

`GalaX16 and other programs <https://github.com/reltham/X16Prog8Code>`_
    Beginnings of a Galaga game for the Commander X16.

`Prog8 code for ZSMkit <https://github.com/mooinglemur/zsmkit/tree/main/p8demo>`_
    ZSMkit is an advanced music and sound effects engine for the Commander X16.

`vtsbank: a library for affine transformation and rotation of sprites and tiles <https://github.com/tallLeRoy/vtsbank>`_
    "VERA Tile Set and Sprite feature" is a module that provides all sorts
    of routines to perform tile and sprite transformations and rotation, using
    the VeraFX hardware feature. Includes examples.

`C64 REU Banking <https://github.com/gillham/prog8reu>`_
    A Prog8 library module that provides Commander X16 style RAM banking on a C64 with an REU.
    This module provides cx16.rambank(), x16jsrfar() and extsub @bank functionality on a C64.

`Library blob link example <https://github.com/FearLabsAudio/Prog8_blobLink_example/>`_
    An example of a simple utility that can link symbols in a main Prog8 program
    so that they are accessable from an externally loaded library blob.
    It pre-processes the debug symbols list file at compile time,
    and substitutes references in a template module file.

`XLink: an alternative library blob link example <https://github.com/gillham/X16/tree/main/xlink>`_
    This is another approach to access routines from a banked loaded library,
    and it does it at run time. In this demo a jump table is not only created in the library,
    but also in the main program and copied into the library for its use.

`Additional custom compilation targets (such as VIC-20) <https://github.com/gillham/prog8targets>`_
    Various custom targets for Prog8 that are not (yet?) part of the Prog8 examples themselves.
    These additional compilation targets may be in varying state of completeness.
    Perhaps most recognisable at the time of adding this link, are the various VIC-20 targets.

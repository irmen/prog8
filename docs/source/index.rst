Prog8 is is a compiled programming language targeting the 8-bit 6502 CPU family.
It aims to provide many conveniences over raw assembly code (even when using a macro assembler),
while still being low level enough to create high performance programs.

Supported target systems are Commodores (C64, C128, PET), Commander X16, and others.

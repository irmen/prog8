;; Proof Of Concept Zsound player using a binary blob version of zsound library by ZeroByte relocated to something usable here.
;; Can play ZSM (music) and ZCM (pcm samples).

; "issues":
; - prog8 (or rather, 64tass) cannot "link" other assembly object files so we have to incbin a binary blob.
; - zsound player ZP usage is only known after compilation of zsound lib. And then this has to be blocked off in the prog8 program.
; - zsound lib BSS section has to be expanded into real zeros as part of the included binary.
; - zsound binary starts with 2 byte prg header that shifts the jump table 2 bytes (not a big issue but a bit untidy)
; - prog8 always sticks main module at the beginning so can't create a container module to stick zsound in (if you want to load it at the beginning)
; - prog8 always has some bootstrap code after the basic launcher so we can only start loading stuff after that
; - prog8 main has to be set to a fixed address (in this case $0830) to which the special zsound binary has been compiled as well.

Various examples for configurable target machines, such as the NEO6502, Atari 800,
Foenix F256, and "tiny" example configurations for the X16 or C64 that provide
more example materials.

Look in the Makefile to see how to build or run the various programs.

*adiee5* has been working on a Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) compilation target
and example program, you can find those efforts here on GitHub: https://github.com/adiee5/prog8-nes-target

*gillham* has been working on a few other compilation targets, such as VIC-20 (various editions), Foenix, and CX16OS.
These will be much more complete than the examples here. You can find them on GitHub: https://github.com/gillham/prog8targets
